Here’s a polished and structured version of your **ITSwR Section 5** notes, with improved formatting and consistency while keeping the content intact:

### **Section 5: Time Series Modelling and Forecasting**

#### **5.1 Purpose**

Trends in time series can be classified as either **stochastic** or **deterministic**.

- A **stochastic trend** is characterized by inexplicable changes in direction, where apparent transient trends may be attributed to high serial correlation with random error.
- **Deterministic trends** and **seasonal variation** can be modeled using regression.
- The **logarithmic transformation**, commonly used to stabilise variance, is also considered.

#### **5.6 Harmonic Seasonal Models**

- **5.6.1 Simulation**  
- **5.6.2 Fit to Simulated Series**

---

#### **5.7 Logarithmic Transformations**

A general model can be written as:  
  **xt = mt × st × zt**  
where:
- *mt* is the trend component  
- *st* is the seasonal component  
- *zt* is the irregular component  

---

#### **5.8 Non-linear Models**

A **linear model** (e.g. a straight-line trend) may be fitted for the series {xt} as follows:  
  **xt = β₀ + β₁t + zt**  
where:
- β₀ and β₁ are model parameters  
- {zt} is a residual time series, which may exhibit autocorrelation

#### **5.9 Forecasting from Regression**

- **5.9.1 Introduction**  
 A **prediction** is a forecast into the future. It involves extrapolating a fitted model by evaluating the model function at future time points.

- **5.9.2 Prediction in R**  
 Implementation using R programming for generating forecasts from regression models.

---

#### **5.10 Inverse Transform and Bias Correction**

- **5.10.1 Log-Normal Residual Errors**  
 Addresses how residuals behave when transformed using logarithms.

- **5.10.2 Empirical Correction Factor for Forecasting Means**  
 The correction factor may be applied when the residual series of a fitted log-regression model approximates **Gaussian white noise**.
