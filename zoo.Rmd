### zoo: An S3 Class and Methods for Indexed Totally Ordered Observations

* A previous version to this introduction to the R package zoo has been published as
Zeileis and Grothendieck (2005) in the Journal of Statistical Software.
zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered
observations, such as discrete irregular time series. 
* Its key design goals are independence
of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the "ts" class for
regular time series.
* This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides
several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting,
merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and
index, coercion and NA handling. 
* A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into
the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series
classes in R
