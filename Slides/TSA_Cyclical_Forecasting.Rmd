## **Tutorial: Cyclical Forecasting and Business Indicators in Time Series Analysis**

### **Part G: Why Trend and Seasonality Are Not Enough**

While forecasting using **trend** and **seasonal** components provides a solid starting point, accurate economic forecasting demands accounting for **cyclical patterns**—medium- to long-term fluctuations often driven by economic expansions and contractions.

Two important reasons to consider cyclical components are:
1. **Forecast period uncertainty**: Economic cycles may shift during the forecast horizon.
2. **Causal clarity**: Identifying the real-world factors that shape these cycles enhances forecast reliability.

### **Short-Term vs Long-Term Forecasting: Role of Cycles**

- In **short-term forecasts**, it's often assumed that the **cyclical behavior** will continue similarly to what’s been observed recently.
- In **long-term or unstable economic environments**, identifying **turning points** in the business cycle becomes essential.

And crucially, **not all products follow the national cycle**. For example:
- **Passenger car sales** tend to follow the general economy.
- **Auto repair part sales**, however, often rise in downturns (a countercyclical behavior).

## **Business Cycle Indicators**

The **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)** groups economic indicators into three key categories:

### **1. Leading Indicators**
These signal turning points **before** they occur in the broader economy. Examples include:
- Average weekly hours worked in manufacturing
- New orders for consumer goods
- Stock market indices

### **2. Coincident Indicators**
These move **simultaneously** with the overall economy. For instance:
- Employment levels
- Industrial production index

### **3. Lagging Indicators**
These indicators change **after** the broader economy shifts. They include:
- Inventory levels in manufacturing and trade
- Prime interest rates charged by banks

## **Analyzing Causal Factors**

Forecasting isn’t just about modeling the past—understanding **why** changes occur is critical. This involves:
- **Regression and correlation analysis** (e.g. examining how sales relate to price)
- Considering future developments such as **new products** or **market shifts**

## **Forecasting with Moving Averages**

A **moving average (MA)** smooths short-term fluctuations by calculating the average of the most recent *n* observations:

\[
\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Sum of the most recent } n \text{ values}}{n}
\]

This method:
- Adjusts with new data by dropping the oldest value and adding the newest
- Is **useful when no trend or seasonality exists**
- Helps identify and filter out **random noise**, but is **not suitable for long-range predictions**
