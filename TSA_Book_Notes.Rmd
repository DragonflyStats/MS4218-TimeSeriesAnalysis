## Section 1: Time Series Foundations

### 1.1 Purpose of Time Series Data

Time series data represents observations collected sequentially over time—common examples include sales, temperatures, or stock prices.

### 1.2 What is a Time Series?

A structured sequence of data points, typically spaced at regular intervals, used for trend analysis and forecasting.

### 1.3 The R Language

- R can be downloaded for free from [www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org).
- For help, type `help.start()` at the R console to access the built-in documentation.
- **R is case sensitive**—variable names like `Data` and `data` are distinct.
- It’s good practice to define variables with capital letters to avoid overwriting internal functions, which are typically lowercase.
- R treats functions as objects and supports object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
- All data in R is stored as **objects**, and you can inspect their structure using `class()`.

### 1.4 Plotting Trends and Seasonal Variation

#### Example: AirPassengers dataset

```r
data(AirPassengers)
AP <- AirPassengers
AP
```

#### Decomposition Example

```r
plot(decompose(Elec.ts))
Elec.decom <- decompose(Elec.ts, type = "mult")
plot(Elec.decom)

Trend <- Elec.decom$trend
Seasonal <- Elec.decom$seasonal

ts.plot(cbind(Trend, Trend * Seasonal), lty = 1:2)
```

## Section 2: Correlation

- **Correlograms** are useful visual tools to examine autocorrelation.
  
### 2.2.2 The Ensemble and Stationarity

The **mean function** of a time series model is often defined as:
  
$$
\mu(t) = E(x_t)
$$

### 2.2.3 Ergodic Series

(Brief explanation can be added here.)

### 2.2.5 Useful Functions

- `cor()` – correlation
- `cov()` – covariance

---

## Section 3: Forecasting Strategies

### 3.3 The Bass Model

- \( f(t) \): Density function  
- \( F(t) \): Cumulative distribution function  
- \( h(t) \): Hazard function

### 3.4 Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters

#### 3.4.1 Exponential Smoothing

(Explain the method or include examples.)

### 3.5 Useful Functions

- `nls()` – non-linear least squares  
- `predict()` – generate predictions from models  
- `coef()` – extract coefficients  
- `ts.union()` – combine multiple time series

### Cross-Correlation Function

```r
ccf(x, y)
```

---

## Section 4: Basic Stochastic Models

### 4.3 Random Walks

- Definition:  
  $$ x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t $$

- **Backward shift operator**:  
  $$ Bx_t = x_{t-1} $$

- **Difference operator**:  
  $$ \nabla x_t = x_t - x_{t-1} $$
