\subsection*{Autocorrelation}

Consider a time series that is stationary in the mean and variance.

The variables may be correlated, and the model second order stationary, if the correlation between variables depend only on the
number of steps between them.

The number of time step between two points in the time line is known as the ``lag".

A correlation of a variable with itself at different times is known as "autocorrelation" or "serial correlation".

if a time series model is 2nd order stationary, we can define an autocovariance function (acvf) as a function of lag $k$ , denoted as $\gamma_k$

\[ \gamma_k = E[ (x_t - \mu) (x_{t+k} - \mu) \]

\[ E[x_t] = E[x_{t+k}] = \mu \]


The autocorrelation function (acf) $\rho_k$ has the following formula.
