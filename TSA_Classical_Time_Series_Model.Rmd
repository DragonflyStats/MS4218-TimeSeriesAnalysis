# Part A: The Classical Time Series Model

A time series is a set of observed values, such as production or sales data, for a sequentially ordered series of time periods.  
Examples include monthly sales of a product or yearly employment numbers in a given industry.

A time series is typically visualized using a line graph, with time on the horizontal axis and measured values on the vertical axis.

## Example 1

A fictional example is shown in Figure 16-1, which presents annual dollar sales for a graphics software company founded in 1990.

- Sales peaked in 1995.
- This was followed by a decline over two years, bottoming out in 1997.
- The final three years displayed renewed sales growth.

## Purpose of Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis seeks to identify and separate time-related influences that affect the series.  
This allows both better interpretation of historical values and more accurate forecasting of future values.

## Components of the Classical Time Series Model

The classical model identifies four components influencing time series values:

1. **Trend (T)**: The long-term direction in the data over several years  
2. **Cyclical Fluctuations (C)**: Recurring multiyear up-and-down movements  
3. **Seasonal Variations (S)**: Repeating patterns within a year, typically using monthly/quarterly data  
4. **Irregular Variations (I)**: Random, non-systematic deviations

These components are assumed to interact multiplicatively:

$$
Y = T \times C \times S \times I
$$

# Part B: Trend Analysis

Trend analysis focuses on the long-term direction in the time series.  
It is usually performed using **annual data**, and typically at least 15â€“20 years of data are recommended to avoid mistaking short-term cycles for true trends.

---

## Linear Trend Using Least Squares

The **least squares method** is commonly used to estimate the trend component:

While not technically a regression (as the dependent variable is deterministic), the trend line helps approximate underlying growth.

When the trend appears linear, the trend equation is:

$$
Y_T = b_0 + b_1 X
$$

- \( b_0 \): Intercept (value of \( Y_T \) when \( X = 0 \))  
- \( b_1 \): Slope (change in \( Y_T \) per unit change in \( X \))  

---

## Exponential Trend Curve

When growth accelerates over time, an **exponential trend** may be more appropriate.  
This is modeled as:

$$
Y_T = b_0 \cdot b_1^X
$$

- \( b_0 \): starting value  
- \( b_1 \): growth rate (e.g., 1.10 implies 10% growth)

Taking logarithms:

$$
\log Y_T = \log b_0 + X \log b_1
$$

This linearizes the exponential curve for easier modeling.

---

## S-Shaped Growth and the Gompertz Curve

Some time series follow an S-curve pattern, with:

- **Introductory stage** of slow growth  
- **Middle stage** of rapid growth  
- **Saturation stage** of slowed growth  

One model to represent this is the **Gompertz curve**, which is expressed as:

$$
Y_T = b_0 \cdot b_1^{b_2^X}
$$

Taking logs:

$$
\log Y_T = \log b_0 + (\log b_1) \cdot b_2^X
$$

This model captures the decelerating growth common in product life cycles.

## Final Notes

The Gompertz curve, exponential and linear models are just a few of the many tools available in time series analysis.  
For practical applications and further mathematical treatment, readers are encouraged to consult specialized resources in forecasting and econometrics.
