\subsection*{Distributed Lag Model}
%=====================%

\begin{itemize}
\item Often the effect of a policy variabke may be distributed over a series of time periods. Therefore a series of lagged explanatory variables is required 
to account for the full adjustment process through time.

\item  A distributed lag model is one in which the current value of the dependent variable Y(t) depends on the weighted sum of present
and past values i.e. x(t),x(t-1)...etc and the error term

\item  Different weights are assigned to different time periods (usually declining successively for earlier time periods).

\item  Lag models ( Koyck, Almon)

\end{itemize}
